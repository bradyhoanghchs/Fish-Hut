         <p>&#10075;&#10075;A friend recommended the Fish Hut to us for lunch and we were not disappointed. They offer a lunch buffet that gives you a choice of meats and vegetables along with a drink. Everything was fresh and hot.&#10076;&#10076;

       <p>&#10075;&#10075;Wow!  We were passing through and stumbled on this amazing place.  All the cars / trucks in the parking lot were a true sign.  This is a REAL catfish place. Hush puppies, fries, onions.  Sure good. When in Savannah, have to stop here...&#10076;&#10076;

       <p> &#10075;&#10075;A local gem.  I asked a lady where the best hamburger in town was at and we were not let down.  Fish looked so good I tried a piece of it too.  It was equally amazing.   This place is right in town but a little hidden.  If in savavnnah you must try it.&#10076;&#10076;

       <p>&#10075;&#10075;Visiting Savannah and ran across this little place. Nothing fancy at all but the food was good, service attentive, portions adequate and if you are a local....your sweet tea was at the table by the time you sat.  Servers were warm and friendly but I can't say the same about the young lady at the register.  Guessing she was having a difficult evening.  Hubby had butterfly shrimp and said it was good. I had grilled lemon pepper fish and was pleasantly surprised. Noticed a lot of regulars ordering the soup and the to-go line was continuous. My only hesitation is most everything is fried and I can't do fried due to reflux issues.&#10076;&#10076;
